# Georgia Public School ESL - Exploratory Data Analysis


## I. Summary:
The purpose of this notebook is to explore some data that the Georgia Dept. of Education provides in its yearly reports on the demographic makeup of students in its public schools. Georgia sees an increased number of students in its ESOL (English for Speakers of other Languages) programs every year, and this script aims to explore how this phenomena has changed in Georgia schools over time, as well as how Georgia schools demographically differ from one another.

## II. Data:
The data used in this notebook comes from files published by the Georgia [Governor's Office of Student Achievement](https://gosa.georgia.gov/downloadable-data). This is data that the GA Dept. of Education collects from schools each year. More information on the strategy used by the GADOE in collecting demographic data from its schools can be found [here](http://gosa.georgia.gov/sites/gosa.georgia.gov/files/OBIEE-Help/Student_&_School_Demographics.htm).


Currently I have just pulled the data from the GA DOE, and I plan to perform analysis on the data when I get the time do so.
