# Georgia Public School ESL - Exploratory Data Analysis 


## I. Summary:
The purpose of this notebook is to explore some data that the Georgia Dept. of Education provides in its yearly reports on the demographic makeup of students in its public schools. Georgia sees an increased number of students in its ESOL (English for Speakers of other Languages) programs every year, and I built this notebook to help explore how this phenomena has changed in Georgia schools over time, as well as how Georgia schools demographically differ from one another.

## II. Data:
The data used in this notebook comes from files published by the Georgia [Governor's Office of Student Achievement](https://gosa.georgia.gov/downloadable-data). This is data that the GA Dept. of Education collects from schools each year. More information on the strategy used by the GADOE in collecting demographic data from its schools can be found [here](http://gosa.georgia.gov/sites/gosa.georgia.gov/files/OBIEE-Help/Student_&_School_Demographics.htm).

## III. Methodology:
TBD!

## IV. Rationale:
This analysis is intended to be purely exploratory in nature. It deals with the presence of immigrant students in American public schools, a topic that is debated in US politics right now. This is a topic that I have observed first hand in Georgia public schools, and it's something that I think about frequently and care about deeply, as my mother is an ESOL teacher in a Georgia public school. I performed this analysis out of my curiousity towards the presence of ESOL students in my home state of Georgia.
