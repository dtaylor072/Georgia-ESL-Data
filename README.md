# Georgia Public School ESL - Exploratory Data Analysis 


## I. Summary:
The purpose of this notebook is to explore some data that the Georgia Dept. of Education provides in its yearly reports on the students in its public schools that are non-native English speakers. Georgia sees an increased number of students in its ESL (English for Speakers of other Languages) programs every year, and I built this notebook to help explore how this phenomena has changed over time, as well as how the impact of immigration affects schools in different ways.

## II. Data:
The data used in this notebook comes from files published by the Georgia [Governor's Office of Student Achievement](https://gosa.georgia.gov/downloadable-data). This is data that the GA Dept. of Education collects from schools each year. More information on the strategy used by the GADOE in collecting demographic data from its schools can be found [here](http://gosa.georgia.gov/sites/gosa.georgia.gov/files/OBIEE-Help/Student_&_School_Demographics.htm).

## III. Methodology:
TBD!

## IV. Rationale:
This analysis is intended to be purely exploratory in nature. It deals with immigration trends, a topic that is hotly debated in US politics right now. However, this is a topic that I have observed first hand in Georgia public schools, and it's something that I think about frequently, as my mother is an ESL teacher in a Georgia public school. I performed this analysis out of curiousity for the nature of the immigration of non-English speakers into Georgia. (I also wanted to work on my scraping and EDA skills).
